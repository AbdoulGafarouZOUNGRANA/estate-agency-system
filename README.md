## 📌 Overview

UNILOGE MAROC is a **complete real estate management system** developed as part of an academic project at  
**École Mohammadia d’Ingénieurs (EMI – Rabat)**.

We simulated a real company that connects:

- 🧑‍🎓 **Students looking for housing**  
- 🏠 **Owners renting their properties**  
- 🧑‍💼 **Supervisors handling visits and coordination**  
- 🏢 **Administrative staff managing HR, contracts, and payments**

The system integrates **Odoo ERP**, **HubSpot CRM**, **AppliCEO**, and a **centralized Excel database**, offering a professional-grade workflow and automation similar to a real real estate agency.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Provide a seamless housing search process for students  
- Allow owners to easily register properties for rent  
- Automate data collection and contact creation  
- Centralize all operations: clients, owners, visits, contracts, HR  
- Offer advanced filtering & matching to connect the right tenant with the right property  
- Simulate a fully operational real estate company
